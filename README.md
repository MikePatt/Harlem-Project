H3 is an app designed to provide the user with information on opportunities to volunteer and to enjoy the food and entertainment available in Harlem.

We use an interface familiar to those who have online dated and it is also easy to learn for those new to apps and smartphones.

By entering your location, either as a zip code or letting your device use its GPS, you can search for events and organizations looking for volunteers and enjoy time afterwards with your friends at Harlem based businesses. 

Please watch as we demonstrate a typical use case
